            <h2>etiquette for a gentleman’s game of pig</h2>
            <p>There are two players. The player whose turn it is dealt two cards. The total of the deal is added to the current player's score, unless either card comes up as a “one”. If this happens, this player's turn is over, and it is the other player’s turn. After each deal, the current player can either be dealt a hand again, (assuming a “one” was not dealt) or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. The first player to get 30 points or higher wins.</p>
            <p>If either gentleman is dealt two “ones” (snake eyes), that player's current score gets zeroed out, and they have to start over, accumulating points from zero.</p>
