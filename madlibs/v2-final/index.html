            <h2>Notice of Eviction</h2>

            <p>Due to the following events, the residents of 1020A and 1020B are no longer eligible to renew their lease the following year. The issues are as follows:</p>

            <p>On the 9th of January, 2025 at <span id="timeday">_____</span>[time of day] the residents at 1020B began the Great War of the Red Door Duplexes. They plotted and planned, and ultimately decided to swap our <span id="houseobj">_____</span>[household object] with their <span id="normobj">_____</span>[object]. In the following morning the 1020A residents awoke to see their updated house and were overcome with <span id="emo">_____</span>[emotion].</p>

            <p>Then on January 11th, 2025, duplex A responded to the actions of their neighbors since their <span id="secondobj">_____</span>[object] was too <span id="adj">_____</span>[adjective]. With some <span id="ving">_____</span>[verb ending in -ing] around, the roommates of duplex A succeeded to <span id="verbed">_____</span>[verb] duplex Bâ€™s [object].</p>

            <p>The final straw occurred on January 13, 2025 when the war reached a new level and 1020B unleashed a surprise: a <span id="animalz">_____</span>[animal] wearing a <span id="atire">_____</span>[piece of clothing]. They rampaged through the duplex, leaving destruction in their wake.</p>

            <p>For the above listed events, the individuals currently residing in 1020A and 1020B will not be allowed to renew their leases the following year, and we will not be providing a letter of reference.</p>
