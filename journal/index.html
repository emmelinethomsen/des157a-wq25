            <!-- <p><time datetime="2025-01-16">Jan 16, 2025</time></p> -->

            <p>Forms are a common part of many websites, applications, online shopping, and more. A designer must keep important considerations in mind when creating a form as many people who spend time online have experienced both good and bad forms.</p>
            <p>I think that if the designer wants the user to have an enjoyable experience and provide the funds or feedback the form requests, they must feel inclined and comfortable doing so. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">This article</a> does a great job explaining some tools designers can implement to ensure better usability. One thing that stuck out to me was their advice to not use inline labels. While it might look more subtle, I have had the experience of forgetting what the prompt was and needing to redo my work. Furthermore, letting the user see the process helps them stay engaged instead of feeling like there is no end in sight on the form. I am curious what strategies we can use to make the webpage show this.</p>
            <p>One website I have interacted with that I think has good usability and form strategies is the <a href="https://www.getcalfresh.org">CalFresh application</a> page. It gives icons, shows progress, explains mistakes, shows what the user selects in multiple choice options, as well as providing easiest questions first.</p>
